# arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulo
# particulary for numbers but some may be fitted on strings and other objects


# logical operators: focus on main three (and, or, not)
# and 
    # always appears between two values and returns true if BOTH values are true


# or
    # returns true if at least one value is true


# not
    # operates on only one operand, returns the neagted opposite value



# Operator Precedence
# each three comes in two versions
    # and , &&
    # or , ||
    # not, !

    # the symbols are prioritized over the word operators




 # comparison operators
# == returns true if both sides are equal
# ex.   
    #  1 == 1 * 1
    #  "a" == "a"

# the usual other operators (<, >, <=, >=)
# comparison operators are most used with conditional statements
# also has a <==>, spaceship operator, for custom sorting


# Operators are Methods
# ex. 
    # number = 2 - 3 / 6
    # translates to
    # number = 2.-(3./(6))
