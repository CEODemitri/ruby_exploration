# methods do genrally one or two things
# 1. answer a question
# 2. perform a command

# methods that are questions
# ex.
array = [3, 4, 5]
p array.sort # here, we are asking the code, how would look sorted

# often, questions need more information
# ex.
name = "hannah"
p name.start_with?("M")

# or 

p array.include?(5)


# methods that excute commands
array.sort! #here, sort! is a command telling the array to sort itself and remain sorted
