## Focus of Repo

Algorithm - Each Algo is a file of its own. Find a concept, explain the concept and practice === one file.

1. In the future (>= 30 .rb files) then I may think about containerizing some files.

WebApps4Beginners - Complete Book from Start to Finish. If Familiar or old content then I should go faster. Every excuse to fail so pointless. Make a win to succeed.

1. Plan A track, Refresh and Complete.

Ruby4Beginners - COMPLETED. This is a good manual for my own reference. No need to edit.

# I will Master Ruby

I wonder why I wish to study Ruby, for sure, I may never be asked to Use such Skill. I think it's more stubborn than any excuse. I Wish to be a better Programmer By All Means. Shrinking my study Span? Stay Confident and Ignorant?
